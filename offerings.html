        <h2>Discover the Charm of Villa Jure</h2>
        <p>
          Villa Jure is a stunning 137m² stone house set in a 300m² garden, home
          to century-old olive trees. <br />
          Enjoy the luxury pool with loungers, an outdoor barbecue, and two
          dining areas—one shaded by the olive trees, perfect for hot summer
          days.
          Inside, the villa blends traditional Croatian stone and wood design
          with modern comforts. It offers two fully equipped kitchens and four
          spacious rooms, each with private bathrooms, accommodating up to 8
          guests. <hr>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Located at the foot of Kozjak mountain, Villa Jure provides
          breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea, nearby islands, and the
          mountains. It’s just 5 minutes from the beach, 10 minutes from Split,
          and 10 minutes from the airport. <hr>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          The villa also features a private playground for children, an indoor
          entertainment area with billiards and table football, a gym, and
          high-speed Wi-Fi. Smoking is permitted outdoors, and there’s private
          parking for two cars. Villa Jure is the ideal retreat for families and
          groups seeking both relaxation and adventure.
